The [Visual Recognition][visual_recognition_service] Service uses deep learning algorithms to analyze images for scenes, objects, faces, text, and other subjects that can give you insights into your visual content. You can organize image libraries, understand an individual image, and create custom classifiers for specific results that are tailored to your needs.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/visual-recognition-nodejs)

## Getting Started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up]. Experimental Watson Services are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.
  ```yaml
  ---
  declared-services:
    visual-recognition-service:
      label: watson_vision_combined
      plan: free
  applications:
  - name: <application-name>
    path: .
    command: npm start
    memory: 512M
    services:
    - visual-recognition-service
    env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  ```

4. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```sh
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

5. Create the Visual Recognition service in Bluemix.
  ```sh
  cf create-service watson_vision_combined free visual-recognition-service
  cf create-service-key visual-recognition-service myKey
  cf service-key visual-recognition-service myKey
  ```

6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  You will update the `.env` with the information you retrieved in steps 5 and 6

  The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none
  VISUAL_RECOGNITION_API_KEY=
  ```

7. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

8. Start the application locally:

  ```none
  npm start
  ```

9. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

10. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

            <your application name>.mybluemix.net

## Environment Variables

  - `VISUAL_RECOGNITION_API_KEY` : This is the API key for the vision service, used if you don't have one in your bluemix account.
  - `PRESERVE_CLASSIFIERS` : Set if you don't want classifiers to be deleted after one hour. *(optional)*
  - `PORT` : The port the server should run on. *(optional, defaults to 3000)*
  - `OVERRIDE_CLASSIFIER_ID` : Set to a classifer ID if you want to always use a custom classifier. This classifier will be used instead of training a new one. *(optional)*

## Changing the Included Images

### Sample Images

The sample images are the first 7 images when the site loads.  They
are called from a Jade mixin found in
`views/mixins/sampleImages.jade`.  If you just want to replace those
images with different images, you can replace them in
`public/images/samples` and they are numbered 1 - 7 and are `jpg`
formatted.

### Custom Classifier Bundles

Adding new/different custom classifer bundles is much more invovled.
You can follow the template of the existing bundles found in
`views/includes/train.jade`.

Or, you can train a custom classifier using the api or the form and
then use the classifier ID.  

## Getting the Classifier ID

When you train a custom classifier, the name of the classifier is
displayed in the test form.

![Classifier ID Tooltip](screengrab-tooltip.png)

If you hover your mouse over the classifier name, the classifier ID
will be shown in the tooltip. You can also click on the name, and it
will toggle between the classifier name and the classifier ID.

You can then use this custom classifier id by placing it after the hash
in the request URL.  For example, lets say you are running the system
locally, so the base URL is `http://localhost:3000` and then you train
a classifier.  This newly trained classifier might have an id like
`SatelliteImagery_859438478`.   If you wanted to use this classifier
instead of training a new one, you can navigate to
`http://localhost:3000/train#SatelliteImagery_859438478` and use the
training form with your existing classifier.

### Privacy Notice

This node sample web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker][deploy_track_url] service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require('cf-deployment-tracker-client').track();` from the beginning of the `server.js` file at the root of this repo.
